UNCHA - Batch Background Removal Tool - USER GUIDE DOCUMENTATION

  This is the Free Version of UNCHA. Please consider paying for the Paid (PREMIUM) Version 
which has more features, no adds, continued support and will help me pay my bills. I'm a 
poor poor person who needs to pay my bills, but I'm not able to sometimes because I have 
soo soo little money. This is the type of ad that will be removed when you pay for the 
Premium version of UNCHA which is on sale for one low price of $5 USD. But there's a sale, 
send me any money at all even a dollar and I'll you can download the PREMIUM Version. Yay!
Now that that's out of the way lets get to the user guide!

  This application will pull all the items in a user specified directory and search that folder 
for any images. The found images are copied, then the copy of the image is processed to have the Background
removed then it is saved as a transparent png with the same name as the original image file to the user
specified target directory.
    Once valid Path in and out are selected click the "Set as Default" buttons to save them for next time.
    Please ensure that the Path in and Path out are not the same directory. 
    Please ensure that the Path in and Path out are specified and valid directories.
    Please ensure that there are image files located in the Path In directory.
